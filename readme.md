# Go List Processes
This application was made as a way to list the processes running in a Windows system.
At some point I will add a functionality to filter the processes found by name, 
but for now it only lists all running processes and prints them.

# How to use
Run the application. No configuration or command line parameters needed.
```shell
go-list-prc.exe
```
